My name is David Nguyen and I'm a senior at UCLA studying Mathematics of Computation. I'm the 
president of the local chapter of the Linux Users Group where I advocate for the use of free and 
open-source software.  

As it pertains computer science, I am interested in backend web development, IT operations, and 
operating systems. Specifically, in my career I would like to tackle the problem of scalability and 
site reliability. Also it is my on-going goal to get more involved with the open source community
and contribute code.  

If you're looking to hire me (*fingers crossed*), the following might be useful:
